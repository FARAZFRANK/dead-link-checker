# Dead Link Checker: The Complete Guide to Finding and Fixing Broken Links on Your WordPress Site

**Are broken links hurting your website's SEO and user experience? Let me show you how Dead Link Checker can help you find and fix them in minutes.**

## Why Should You Care About Broken Links?

Let's be honest. Nobody likes clicking on a link only to see that annoying "404 Page Not Found" error. It's frustrating for your visitors, and guess what? Search engines don't like it either.

Here's what broken links can do to your website:

- **Hurt your SEO rankings** – Google sees broken links as a sign of poor website maintenance
- **Drive visitors away** – If people can't find what they're looking for, they'll leave
- **Damage your credibility** – A website full of dead links looks unprofessional
- **Waste your link juice** – All those backlinks pointing to broken pages? They're not helping you anymore

The problem is, finding broken links manually is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If you have hundreds of blog posts, pages, and products, checking each link one by one could take weeks.

That's where **Dead Link Checker** comes in.

## What is Dead Link Checker?

Dead Link Checker is a professional WordPress plugin that automatically scans your entire website, finds all broken links, and helps you fix them quickly. It's like having a personal assistant who constantly monitors your site for dead links so you don't have to.

Whether you run a small blog or a large e-commerce site, this plugin works quietly in the background, keeping your links healthy and your SEO intact.

## Key Features That Make Dead Link Checker Stand Out

### 1. Comprehensive Content Scanning

Unlike basic link checkers that only scan posts and pages, Dead Link Checker goes much deeper. It scans:

- **Posts and Pages** – All your standard WordPress content
- **Custom Post Types** – WooCommerce products, portfolios, testimonials, you name it
- **Navigation Menus** – Links in your header and footer menus
- **Text Widgets** – Sidebar and footer widget links
- **Comments** – Links that visitors have left in comments
- **Custom Fields & ACF** – Links stored in Advanced Custom Fields

This means no broken link can hide from you. Every corner of your website gets checked.

### 2. Full Page Builder Support

Are you using Elementor, Divi, or WPBakery to build your pages? Many link checkers can't see inside page builder content. Dead Link Checker can.

It works seamlessly with:

- **Gutenberg** (WordPress Block Editor)
- **Elementor**
- **Divi Builder**
- **WPBakery Page Builder**

So even those fancy custom layouts you've built? All the links inside them get checked too.

### 3. Multiple Link Types Detection

Dead Link Checker doesn't just check webpage links. It also checks:

- **Internal Links** – Links pointing to your own pages
- **External Links** – Links pointing to other websites
- **Images** – Broken image links that show as missing images
- **YouTube Embeds** – Videos that have been deleted or made private

This gives you a complete picture of all the broken resources on your site.

### 4. Flexible Scan Settings

You're in control of how the plugin scans your website:

- **Scan Frequency** – Choose daily, weekly, or monthly scans
- **Concurrent Requests** – Set how many links to check at once (1-10)
- **Request Timeout** – Configure how long to wait before marking a link as broken (5-60 seconds)

If you have a busy server, you can slow things down. If you want faster scans, crank up the speed. It's your choice.

### 5. Powerful Redirect Manager

Found a broken link? Instead of editing every page where it appears, just set up a redirect. Dead Link Checker includes a built-in redirect manager with:

- **301 Redirects** (Permanent) – For links that have moved forever
- **302 Redirects** (Temporary) – For temporary moves
- **307 Redirects** (Temporary) – Alternative temporary redirect
- **Hit Counter** – See how many times each redirect is used
- **Import/Export** – Backup and restore your redirects easily

This is especially useful if you've restructured your site or migrated from another platform.

### 6. Easy-to-Use Dashboard

The dashboard shows you everything at a glance:

- Total links checked
- Number of broken links found
- Links by status (working, broken, redirected)
- Recent scan results
- Quick actions to fix issues

No complicated settings. No confusing interfaces. Just the information you need to keep your site healthy.

### 7. Quick Fix Options

When you find a broken link, you can:

- **View it** – See where the link appears and what page it's on
- **Dismiss it** – Ignore links you know about (like intentionally broken test links)
- **Recheck it** – Verify if a link that was broken is now working
- **Edit directly** – Jump straight to the post editor to fix it
- **Bulk actions** – Fix multiple links at once

No need to hunt through your content. Everything is just one click away.

### 8. Export Reports

Need to share your broken link report with a client or your team? Export everything to:

- **CSV format** – Open in Excel or Google Sheets
- **JSON format** – For developers and automation

Keep records, generate reports, or import into other tools. The choice is yours.

### 9. Email Notifications

Don't want to log in every day to check for broken links? Set up email notifications:

- Get notified when new broken links are found
- Receive weekly or monthly digest reports
- Customize what gets sent and when

Stay informed without lifting a finger.

### 10. Multisite Support

Running a WordPress multisite network? Dead Link Checker has you covered:

- Works across all sites in your network
- Network dashboard for admins
- Manage everything from one place

Perfect for agencies managing multiple client sites.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1: The Growing Blog

You started a blog 3 years ago. You've published 500 posts. Some of those posts link to websites that no longer exist. Some link to your old pages that you've since deleted. Dead Link Checker scans everything and shows you exactly what needs fixing.

### Case 2: The E-commerce Store

You sell products with affiliate links to Amazon, suppliers, and partners. Products get discontinued. Affiliate programs change. URLs expire. Without checking, you're sending customers to error pages and losing sales.

### Case 3: The Agency

You manage 20 client websites. Each client expects their site to be perfect. Running manual link checks on 20 sites? That would take forever. With multisite support, you can monitor everything from one dashboard.
